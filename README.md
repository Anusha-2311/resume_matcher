### **Classification Logic & Score Calculation**  

#### **Skill Extraction**  
- **spaCy** is used for **tokenization** and **NLP processing**. The resume text is processed to identify key skills from predefined skill lists. 
- Skills are checked against both the resume and job description for relevance.
  
#### **Job Role Matching**  
- The algorithm uses the skills extracted from the resume and job description to match the best possible job role. Currently, it predicts a set of **static job roles** based on extracted skills. A more advanced version could use **job role APIs** for dynamic role prediction.

#### **Match Score Calculation**  
- The **match score** is calculated as the ratio of common skills between the resume and job description. The formula used is:  
  \[
  \text{Match Score} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Common Skills}}{\text{Total Skills in Job Description}} \right) \times 100
  \]
- This score provides a **percentage** indicating how closely the resume aligns with the job description. A higher match score means a better fit for the job.

#### **Improvement Suggestions**  
- If the match score is below a certain threshold (e.g., 70%), the system provides feedback on missing skills from the resume that are present in the job description. This is done by identifying the **unmatched skills** between the two.
